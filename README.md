# Global Development Dashboard (1952-2007)

Hi there! 👋 I'm Hilâl Gökçe Sarıçam, a Computer Engineering student. This project is an interactive dashboard I built to explore global development trends. Using the Gapminder dataset, you can dive into how GDP, Life Expectancy, and Population have changed for over 140 countries between 1952 and 2007.

My goal was to create more than just a chart-generator; I wanted to build a tool that actually "talks" to the user by providing automated insights and a smooth, intuitive experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Quick & Easy Analysis:** Whether you want to see a single country's progress or put two nations head-to-head, it only takes a few clicks.
- **Smart Insights:** You don't have to be a data scientist to understand the numbers. The dashboard automatically calculates growth percentages and gaps between countries for you.
- **Clean & Precise:** I've formatted all metrics to two decimal places to keep things professional and easy on the eyes. No messy long numbers here!
- **Take the Data with You:** Found something interesting? You can download the specific country data as a CSV file with one click.
- **User-Friendly Flow:** From the welcome screen to the data tables, I designed the interface to guide you through the analysis step-by-step.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python:** The backbone of the entire project.
- **Streamlit:** Used to transform Python scripts into this interactive web app.
- **Pandas:** My go-to library for data cleaning and analytical calculations.
- **GitHub:** For version control and documentation.

## 🚀 How to Use It

1. Select a **Main Country** from the "Control Panel" on the left.
2. (Optional) Turn on **Comparison Mode** to pick a second country.
3. Check out the **Automated Summary** box for a quick takeaway.
4. Use the **Download** button at the bottom if you need the raw data for your own work.
